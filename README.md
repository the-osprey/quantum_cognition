# quantum_cognition
This repo contains much of the research I have been conducting for my honors thesis for UC Berkeley Economics. Some documents and programs are not contained at the moment, as they are in development (incl. ML algo). 

Interestingly, most of this research is in Mathematics, Cognitive Science, and psychology! However, it does have economic applications among others. My ultimate goal  is to apply this to Neural Nets as there are some fascinating opportunites with this.

You can find my quantum probability model in the Jupyter Notebook files. The research based papers are TeX documents.
