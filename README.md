#### A brief overview

This repo contains much of the research I have been conducting for my honors thesis for the last few months. Some documents and programs are not contained at the moment, as they are in development. It is regarding decision making under conflict. That is, humans *do not* follow traditional Baysian probability theory. Rather, recent research has shown that a superset of classical probability theory, John von Neumann's quantum probability theory, helps model this behavior much more accurately. The applications of this field ranges from cognitive science, to economics, to machine learning.

To get more acquainted with the field, feel free to skim some of the papers. The Khrennikov and Haven paper provides the best overview. 

My ultimate goal  is to apply this to neural nets as there are some fascinating opportunites with this.
